# feynman-path-integral-simulator
A visual and interactive simulation of Feynman's path integral formulation using Monte Carlo methods. This notebook samples thousands of random paths between two points to model quantum interference. It features animated plots showing sample paths, interference patterns, and complex phasor sums.
